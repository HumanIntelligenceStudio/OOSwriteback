## ðŸŽ¯ **Implementation Notes**

- **Keep it simple**: Basic payment creation and tracking only
- **Admin-only access**: All payment features behind admin authentication
- **No user restrictions**: Don't change current free OperatorOS access
- **Test mode first**: Use Stripe test keys for initial implementation
- **Minimal UI**: Clean, functional admin interface additions
- **Database integration**: Use existing PostgreSQL setup
- **Notification integration**: Leverage existing admin notification system

This provides a straightforward payment processing capability within your existing OperatorOS infrastructure without disrupting the current user experience.
