"I help businesses implement AI strategically. With 13+ years of healthcare operations experience, I understand how to make AI work in complex, regulated environments. My clients typically see 20-30% operational efficiency improvements and $50K-$200K annual cost savings. I offer three core services: AI strategy development at $200/hour, implementation planning at $175/hour, and training support at $150/hour. My approach is practical, not theoretical - I focus on real business results, not just technology. Would you like to schedule a 30-minute consultation to discuss your AI opportunities?"

### üïë HOUR 2: DEMO SCENARIOS AND RESPONSES

**Prepare for Common Demo Questions:**

**Q: "What makes you different from other AI consultants?"**
A: "My healthcare operations background gives me unique insight into how AI works in complex, regulated environments. I've seen what works and what doesn't in real-world business operations. Plus, I focus on practical implementation that delivers measurable ROI, not just fancy technology demos."

**Q: "Can you give us a specific example?"**
A: "I recently helped a healthcare system optimize their patient scheduling. We implemented AI-powered resource allocation that reduced scheduling conflicts by 35% and saved $150,000 annually. The project took 6 months from strategy to full implementation."

**Q: "What's your typical engagement process?"**
A: "I start with a 30-minute assessment to understand your challenges, then provide a customized AI strategy roadmap. Implementation planning includes technical architecture, vendor evaluation, and project timelines. I also provide training and ongoing support to ensure your team can maximize the AI investment."

**Q: "How do you price your services?"**
A: "My hourly rates range from $150-$250 depending on the complexity. I also offer fixed-price packages: AI Strategy Assessment for $1,500, Implementation Planning for $3,500, and comprehensive Training Programs for $2,500. Most clients see 300-500% ROI within the first year."

**Q: "How quickly can you get started?"**
A: "I can begin immediately with a consultation. Strategy development typically takes 2-4 weeks, implementation planning 3-6 weeks. The timeline depends on your specific needs and complexity, but I pride myself on faster delivery than industry average."
