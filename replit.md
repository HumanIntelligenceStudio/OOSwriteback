# Multi-Agent AI Conversation System

## Overview

This is a Flask-based web application that implements a multi-agent AI conversation system. The application allows users to interact with different AI agents, each with specialized roles and capabilities. The system uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to power the AI agents and maintains conversation history in memory.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a simple Flask web application architecture with the following key characteristics:

### Frontend Architecture

- **Performance Optimization**: Strategic database indexing for improved query performance

## Key Components

### Agent System
- **Base Agent Class**: Extensible class structure for different AI agent types
- **Agent Specialization**: Each agent has a unique name, role, and system prompt
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses OpenAI's chat completions API for response generation
- **Conversation Context**: Maintains conversation history for context-aware responses

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Framework supports multiple specialized AI agents including OperatorOS loop and C-Suite executives
- **C-Suite Executive Agents**: 7 specialized executive AI agents (CSA, COO, CTO, CFO, CMO, CPO, CIO) for strategic intelligence
- **Conversation Management**: Tracks and maintains conversation history in PostgreSQL database
- **Real-time Interaction**: AJAX-based communication for seamless user experience

- **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive monitoring and management interface for administrators
- **Database Persistence**: All conversations survive server restarts and are permanently stored

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: User submits input through the web interface
2. **Session Management**: Flask creates or retrieves existing session
3. **Agent Selection**: System determines which agent(s) should respond
4. **Context Preparation**: Conversation history is prepared for the AI model
5. **OpenAI API Call**: Request sent to OpenAI with system prompt and context
6. **Response Processing**: AI response is processed and formatted
7. **Storage Update**: Conversation history is updated in memory
8. **UI Update**: Frontend is updated with the new response
