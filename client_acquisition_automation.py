I specialize in helping healthcare organizations implement AI solutions that actually deliver measurable ROI - specifically focusing on HIPAA-compliant implementations that enhance rather than complicate clinical workflows.

Recent example: Helped a 300-bed hospital reduce administrative burden by 40% while improving diagnostic accuracy by 25% through strategic AI implementation.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute conversation about how AI might support {company}'s objectives? I have a few specific ideas that might be relevant based on your recent initiatives.

1. They start with clear use cases tied to specific operational pain points
2. They prioritize HIPAA compliance from day one
3. They have executive sponsorship for change management

I'd love to share how we've helped similar organizations navigate these challenges successfully.
