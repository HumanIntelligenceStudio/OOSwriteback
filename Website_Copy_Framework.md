## About Page Narrative

### Epic Consulting About Page
```
From Boston Children's Hospital to Your Organization

After 13 years optimizing Epic systems at one of America's premier children's hospitals, I discovered that most healthcare organizations were only scratching the surface of Epic's potential.

The problem wasn't Epic‚Äîit was implementation approach.

Large consulting firms deploy junior consultants with textbook knowledge. Epic Professional Services follows templated approaches. Independent consultants often lack institutional credibility.

Healthcare organizations needed something different: proven expertise, institutional credibility, and nomadic flexibility.

That's why I founded Epic Consulting.

MY APPROACH:
‚Ä¢ Senior-level expertise on every engagement
‚Ä¢ Real-world experience across all Epic modules
‚Ä¢ Flexible delivery: on-site when critical, remote when efficient
‚Ä¢ Long-term partnership, not project-and-exit

THE RESULTS:
‚Ä¢ 40% average productivity improvement
‚Ä¢ $2M+ cost savings per engagement
‚Ä¢ 98% client satisfaction rate
‚Ä¢ Zero failed implementations

Your Epic investment deserves expert optimization.

### OperatorOS About Page
```
The Future of Personal Optimization Has Arrived

What if you could hire the world's best CFO, COO, CMO, CTO, CSA, CPO, and CIO?

For most people, that's impossible. These executives cost $300K-$500K annually each, and they're focused on companies, not individual life optimization.

But what if AI could change that?

OperatorOS is the world's first personal life operating system powered by seven specialized AI agents, each trained to executive-level expertise in their domain.

WHY SEVEN AGENTS?
Life optimization isn't a single-AI problem. Financial planning requires CFO-level intelligence. Productivity optimization needs COO expertise. Strategic planning demands CSA-level thinking.

Single AI assistants are generalists. OperatorOS agents are specialists.

THE VISION:
Every person deserves access to executive-level intelligence across all life domains. OperatorOS democratizes the C-Suite, making sophisticated life optimization accessible to anyone committed to growth.

YOUR PERSONAL AI C-SUITE:
üîπ CFO: Wealth building & financial independence
üîπ COO: Operations & productivity optimization
üîπ CSA: Strategic planning & decision frameworks
üîπ CMO: Personal brand & growth acceleration
üîπ CTO: Technology & automation systems
üîπ CPO: Health & relationship optimization
üîπ CIO: Intelligence synthesis & insight generation

The future of personal optimization isn't more apps or tools.
It's intelligent coordination.
