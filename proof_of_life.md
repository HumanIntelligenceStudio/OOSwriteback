## 🔬 **Current Human-Clarity Analysis**

**Analyst Agent Performance:**
- **Critical Findings:** 
  - Very low clarity score (16.75/100) indicates poor human understanding
  - No empathy indicators detected in response
  - Extremely low actionability score (12.5/100)
  - Poor loop completion score (15.0/100)

**Improvement Opportunities:**
- Add empathy language and emotional resonance
- Provide more actionable, specific guidance
- Improve clarity and human-centered communication
- Better close mental loops for user satisfaction
